<p>
 How can we put in place effective countermeasures if we donÂ´t know which approaches and techniques the attacker will use? 

</p></blockquote>
</pre></code>
<p>
This problem can be addressed by using cyber threat intelligence. The Threat Intelligence process goal is to profile the adversary by making use of information that can be gathered from previous attacks, public and private repositories. 
</p>

<div id="CTI: Theoretical Elements-Information"><h2 id="Information" class="header"><a href="#CTI: Theoretical Elements-Information">Information</a></h2></div>

<p>
The intelligence process is the foundation of the CTI process, the very basic component of an intelligence process is the <em>information</em>. By the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Information can be defined as
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 Any fact or set of facts, knowledge, news, or advice, whether communicated by others or obtained by personal study and investigation; any datum that reduces uncertainty about the state of any part of the world; intelligence; knowledge derived from reading, observation, or instruction.

</p></blockquote>
</pre></code>
<p>
In the cyber domain the information that we can collect comes from different sources, such as malware, monitoring tools, application logs, application servers, Operating System, and VPNs; information can be collected from external sources like public or private repositories or can be bought.
</p>

<p>
This huge set of heterogeneous information can be:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Loosely structured, or

<li>
strictly structured.

<li>
Low level (technically speaking), or

<li>
high level, written in natural language. 

</ul>
<p>
Information in its raw state is difficult to use, and only by putting together all the traces left behind by an attacker would be possible to construct <em>part of</em> the history of the attack. When an analyst is capable of producing a credible hypothesis, actionable improvements can be made in the mitigation and defense capabilities of an organization.
</p>

<p>
An analyst need <span id="CTI: Theoretical Elements-Information-actionable intelligence"></span><strong id="actionable intelligence">actionable intelligence</strong> to produce a credible hypothesis, for this reason an intelligence process must be deployed to extract actionable intelligence from noise. 
</p>

<p>
From the firs huge set of <em>data</em> collected defined as <span id="CTI: Theoretical Elements-Information-noise"></span><strong id="noise">noise</strong>, the intelligence process extracts only the elements that are potentially relevant for the analyst. This first subset of information defined <span id="CTI: Theoretical Elements-Information-data"></span><strong id="data">data</strong>, data can be organized in different groups according to defining characteristics. A subset of data with a specific purpose is defined as <span id="CTI: Theoretical Elements-Information-information"></span><strong id="information">information</strong>, information has a specific strategic purpose but is made up of independent pieces. By <em>connecting the dots</em> <span id="CTI: Theoretical Elements-Information-actionable intelligence"></span><strong id="actionable intelligence">actionable intelligence</strong> is obtained, the adjective <em>actionable</em> highlights the fact that the distilled information can be used to understand how a successful attack happened and how to act to avoid a similar attack in the future.
</p>

<p>
The Intelligence Process is complex and iterative, and it is mostly a human centered activity.
